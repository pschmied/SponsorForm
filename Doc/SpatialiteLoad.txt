Notes for populating a Spatialite database from an ESRI file geodatabase (.gdb directory)

This method assumes Windows and involves an intermediate translation step to an ESRI personal geodb (.mdb file). A cleaner method would be to compile GDAL with ESRI's FileGDB support built in (http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/FileGDB). However, building anything on Windows can be a pain. Building GDAL .gdb support on OS X/Linux looks like a straightforward --configure option.

Prerequisites (Windows):
1. OSGeo4W install with most GDAL stuff installed
2. File GeoDB populated with layers and sundry

Process:
1. Convert to personal geodb via ArcCatalog
2. Convert to spatialite via ogr2ogr:
C:\>ogr2ogr -a_srs EPSG:2285 -f SQLite -dsco SPATIALITE=yes -gt 65536 C:\Users\PeterS\Dropbox\PSRC\T2040Priortization\SponsorForm\Prioritization.sqlite C:\Users\PeterS\Dropbox\PSRC\T2040Priortization\SponsorForm\Prioritization.mdb


Prerequisites (Mac OS X):
1. Install ESRI FileGDB libs, link .dylib to .so
2. Compile complete gdal from homebrew

Process:
1. Convert to spatialite via ogr2ogr:
$ ogr2ogr -a_srs EPSG:2285 -f SQLite -dsco SPATIALITE=yes -gt 65536 Prioritization.sqlite Prioritization.gdb
